  "treatmentDescriptions": "Coronary Heart Disease :   In patients with coronary heart disease and hypercholesterolemia  Simvaxon is indicated to:    - Reduce the risk of total mortality by reducing coronary death    - Reduce the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction    - Reduce the risk for undergoing myocardial revascularization procedures    - Reduce the risk of stroke and transient ischemic attacks (TIA's).   Hyperlipidemia:   Simvaxon is indicated as an adjunct to diet to reduce elevated TOTAL-C  LDL-C  Apo B and TG  and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia ( heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia (Frederickson Types IIa and IIb)  Simvaxon therefore  lowers the LDL-C/HDL-C and the total-C/HDL-C ratios. Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia:   Simvaxon is also indicated as an adjunct to diet and other non-dietary measures in reducing elevated total cholesterol  LDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein B in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia when response to these measures is inadequate.   Hypertriglyceridemia (Fredrickson type IV hyperlipidemia):   Simvaxon is indicated for the treatment of patients with hypertriglyceridemia (Fredrickson type IV hyperlipidemia).  Dysbetalipoproteinemia (Fredrickson type III hyperlipidemia):  Simvaxon is indicated for the treatment of patients with primary dysbetalipoproteinemia (Fredrickson type III hyperlipidemia).",
