Clinical benefit such as improvement in disease-related symptoms or increase in overall survival has not been demonstrated. - Treatment of progressive neuroendocrine tumors of pancreatic origin (PNET) in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic disease. The safety and effectiveness of EVETOR in the treatment of patients with carcinoid tumors have not been established. - Treatment of hormone receptor – positive, HER2/neu negative advanced breast cancer, in combination with exemestane, in postmenopausal women without symptomatic visceral disease after recurrence or progression following a non – steroidal aromatase inhibitor. - Treatment of adult patients with renal angiomyolipoma and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), not requiring immediate surgery.
