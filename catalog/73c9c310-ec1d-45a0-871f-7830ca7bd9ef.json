  "treatmentDescriptions": "Singulair 10 mg is indicated in adult and adolescents 15 years of age and older for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma including prevention of daytime and nighttime symptoms of the treatment of aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients and the prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.   Singulair is effective alone or in combination with other agents used in the maintenance treatment of chronic asthma. Singulair and inhaled corticosteroids may be used concomitantly with additive effects to control asthma or to reduce the inhaled corticosteroid dose while maintaining clinical stability. Singulair is indicated for the relief of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis in adults and pediatric patients 2 years of age and older.Because the benefits of SINGULAIR may not outweigh the risk of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with seasonal rhinitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], reserve use for patients who have an intolerance to alternative therapies.",
